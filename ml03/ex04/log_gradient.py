        x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of shape m * n.
        y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of shape m * 1.
        theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of shape (n + 1) * 1.
    Returns:
        The gradient as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of shape n * 1, containing the result of the formula for all j.
        None if x, y, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
        None if x, y and theta do not have compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
